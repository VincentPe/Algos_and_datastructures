# Algorithms and data structures
Coursera specialization on software engineering skills covering many different algorithms and 
data structures. In an attempt to not directly be found (as this repo provides answer to 
project assignments) the University that offers these courses is the one in most South-West USA. <br>
Folder structure and python files are changed in name slightly for the same purpose. <br>

In general this specialization focuses on:
- Finding the right algorithms to solve problems
- Using the right data structures to implement solutions
- Writing efficient code that runs as fast as possible (all exercises are time capped)
- Stress testing (with edge cases)
- Debugging

I have completed the exercises and quizzes in Python on the following topics:

Algorithmic Toolbox
- Naive solutions
- Greedy algorithms
- Computation runtimes
- Stress testing
- Sorting and searching
- Divide-and-Conquer
- Dynamic programming
- Recursive programming

Data Structures
- Dynamic arrays
- Linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Priority queues
- Disjoint sets
- Hash tables
- Binary search trees

Algorithms on graphs
- Graph representation and decomposition
- DAGs
- Strongy connected components
- Topo sort
- Breadth first search
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Minimum Spanning Trees
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Bidrectional search
- A* Algorithm
- Highway Hierarchies and preprocessing
- Witness Search



TODO:
- String algorithms
- Advanced and complex algorithms
- Final programming challenge capstone
